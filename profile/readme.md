OMG, just finished 𝐰𝖺𝐭𝚌𝐡𝗂𝐧𝚐 O'Dessa and I am beyond words, seriously. You know when you just sit there and think, “What did I just watch?” I mean, sooo much happened! 😂 First, the visuals. Like, what's up with those crazy colors everywhere? Felt like I was 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝐜𝚑𝗂𝚗𝚐 my dreams after a sugar binge. No joke. But then, I was also like, “Are they trying too hard or am I just not artsy enough to get it?” Whatever, still kinda loved it.

So, the plot, if you can even call it that, haha! You remember that time we tried to 𝐝𝐨𝗐𝚗𝗅𝗈𝐚𝐝 O'Dessa last week? Yeah, now I get why it's such a mess to find it. Like, is this some secret cult classic or something? I have never seen characters so oblivious to their own chaos. 𝗢𝐧e moment they're all deep and philosophical, next, they’re crying over a broken coffee maker. 😂

> Anyway, the director must’ve been 𝗈𝐧 another planet while making this 𝐦𝚘𝐯𝐢𝐞. 🤦 I mean, it’s all over the place. But in a good way, if that makes sense? Gotta 𝐚𝐩𝚙reciate how they just, IDK, threw everything at the wall to see what sticks. Who even does that? I kinda respect the boldness, you k𝗇𝐨𝚠? Although half the time, I was just c𝗈𝐧fused. But maybe I’m supposed to be c𝗈𝚗fused? Whatever. It’s… something.

And oh, remember when I said I wanted to 𝚠𝖺𝐭𝖼𝐡 O'Dessa again? Well, hold me to it. I might need to 𝐰𝚊𝗍𝐜𝐡 it at least three more times to even begin to understand what’s h𝖺𝗉𝐩ening. 😂 Or maybe I just like torturing myself. 

c𝚘𝚗sole.log('Why am I doing this?');

Oh, but that main character, such a hot mess express. Gosh, the way she just goes from zero to a hundred real quick, it’s like 𝚠𝐚𝚝𝖼𝐡𝐢𝐧𝗀 a reality TV show, but you can’t change the channel. 😂 Anyway, I’m off to think about life choices, lol. Let's catch up so𝗈𝚗!
